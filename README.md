# Stocker

I recently started to look into the Django framework for python and it seemed really interesting to use as I have only really used vanilla python for my previous projects. I decided with this new found interest i would create a project using this as well as my interest in the investment sector to builder stocker. An app to solve investment illiteracy.

The goals for this project as follows:

-- Build the web to show the best raisers and losers of the day
-- Build a detailed view on any assert with various graphs and useful information (news, climate etc)                             ---------+
-- Build a prediction model to gain and insight into whether a stock is currently under valued or undervalued                              |
-- Build a seperate model to understand when these stocks have historically raisen based on specific events                                | -- Lots of models (Probably will be more)
-- Build another model to predicte the likely ROI + time of said stock                                                                     |
-- build a model so as user you can decide what the best investment is for you based on age, risk tolorance and future earnings.  ---------+
-- Hopefully at some point use my findings to build a business :)
